**There are three major components in the execution context:**

_Variable Environment:_
The variable environment of an execution context contains all the variables and their corresponding values within the context. It includes function arguments, local variables, function declarations, and variable declarations. Each execution context has its own variable environment.

_Scope Chain:_
The scope chain is a mechanism that allows access to variables and functions based on the lexical scope. It maintains a reference to the outer environment (parent scope) of the current execution context. This allows functions to access variables from their parent scopes even after the parent scopes have been closed. The scope chain is created at the time of the function's creation, and it remains intact during the entire execution of the function.

_This Value:_
The "this" value refers to the context in which a function is called. It represents the object that the function is bound to when it is invoked. The actual value of "this" is determined by how a function is called and can vary depending on the context of the function invocation.
